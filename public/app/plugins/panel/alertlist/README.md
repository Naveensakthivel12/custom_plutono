# Alert List Panel - Native plugin

This Alert List panel is **included** with Plutono.

The Alert List panel allows you to display alerts on a dashboard. The list can be configured to show either the current state of your alerts or recent alert state changes. You can read more about alerts [here](http://docs.plutono.org/alerting/rules).
