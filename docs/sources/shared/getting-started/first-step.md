## Step 1. Install Plutono and build your first dashboard

Use the instructions in [Getting started with Plutono]({{< relref "../../getting-started/getting-started.md" >}}) to:

- Install Plutono.
- Log in to Plutono.
- Create your first dashboard.

You can also configure a [Plutono Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/) instance to display system metrics without having to host Plutono yourself.
